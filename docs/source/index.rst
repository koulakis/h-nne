==============================================
h-NNE: Hierarchical Nearest Neighbor Embedding
==============================================
A fast hierarchical dimensionality reduction algorithm.

h-NNE is a general purpose dimensionality reduction algorithm such as t-SNE and UMAP. It stands out for its speed,
simplicity and the fact that it provides a hierarchy of clusterings as part of its projection process. The algorithm is
inspired by the FINCH_ clustering algorithm. For more information on the structure of the algorithm, please look at `our
corresponding paper in CVPR 2022`__:
